# Internet-of-Things-and-Smart-Homes-using-Distributed-Systems-in-Java
Various Sensors Communicate using RMI in java, clock synchronization is achieved

# Multi-tier,Multi Thread  Based Model

The application is based on Multithreaded Model. Every single action is categorized as separate thread spawn by the Gateway to handle Blocking calls. 
The total application is implemented on Java Platform using RMI.  
Once the Application is started, all the Components register at Gateway.


# This Project has two phases

Phase 1 : Leader Election, Clock Synchronization between various systems, Logical clock Implementation, Backend Database(log file) 

Phase 2 : Fault Tolerance, Consistency, Optimization of database look up using Least Recently Used Cache

# Detail Explanation of Techniques and Testing Procedure

The files mentioned above as Project_Report_Phase_1.pdf and Project_Report_Phase_1.pdf will give detailed explanation (using Block Diagrams and Timing Diagrams) regarding various techniques implemented to achieve the above mentioned goals in each phase.(Kindly refer them to understand the entire Project)
